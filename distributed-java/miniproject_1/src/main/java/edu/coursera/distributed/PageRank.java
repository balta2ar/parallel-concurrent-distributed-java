     * TODO Given an RDD of websites and their ranks, compute new ranks for all
     * websites and return a new RDD containing the updated ranks.
     *
     * Recall from lectures that given a website B with many other websites
     * linking to it, the updated rank for B is the sum over all source websites
     * of the rank of the source website divided by the number of outbound links
     * from the source website. This new rank is damped by multiplying it by
     * 0.85 and adding that to 0.15. Put more simply:
     *
     *   new_rank(B) = 0.15 + 0.85 * sum(rank(A) / out_count(A)) for all A linking to B
     *
     * For this assignment, you are responsible for implementing this PageRank
     * algorithm using the Spark Java APIs.
     *
     * The reference solution of sparkPageRank uses the following Spark RDD
     * APIs. However, you are free to develop whatever solution makes the most
     * sense to you which also demonstrates speedup on multiple threads.
