    /**
     * A parallel implementation of matrix multiply using MPI to express SPMD
     * parallelism. In particular, this method should store the output of
     * multiplying the matrices a and b into the matrix c.
     *
     * This method is called simultaneously by all MPI ranks in a running MPI
     * program. For simplicity MPI_Init has already been called, and
     * MPI_Finalize should not be called in parallelMatrixMultiply.
     *
     * On entry to parallelMatrixMultiply, the following will be true of a, b,
     * and c:
     *
     *   1) The matrix a will only be filled with the input values on MPI rank
     *      zero. Matrix a on all other ranks will be empty (initialized to all
     *      zeros).
     *   2) Likewise, the matrix b will only be filled with input values on MPI
     *      rank zero. Matrix b on all other ranks will be empty (initialized to
     *      all zeros).
     *   3) Matrix c will be initialized to all zeros on all ranks.
     *
     * Upon returning from parallelMatrixMultiply, the following must be true:
     *
     *   1) On rank zero, matrix c must be filled with the final output of the
     *      full matrix multiplication. The contents of matrix c on all other
     *      ranks are ignored.
     *
     * Therefore, it is the responsibility of this method to distribute the
     * input data in a and b across all MPI ranks for maximal parallelism,
     * perform the matrix multiply in parallel, and finally collect the output
     * data in c from all ranks back to the zeroth rank. You may use any of the
     * MPI APIs provided in the mpi object to accomplish this.
     *
     * A reference sequential implementation is provided below, demonstrating
     * the use of the Matrix class's APIs.
     *
     * @param a Input matrix
     * @param b Input matrix
     * @param c Output matrix
     * @param mpi MPI object supporting MPI APIs
     * @throws MPIException On MPI error. It is not expected that your
     *                      implementation should throw any MPI errors during
     *                      normal operation.
