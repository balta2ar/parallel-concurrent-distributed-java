             * file in a separate thread. You are free to choose how that new

             * the handling of HTTP messages are the same as in MiniProject 2,
             * but are repeated below for convenience:
             *
             *   a) Using Socket.getInputStream(), parse the received HTTP
             *      packet. In particular, we are interested in confirming this
             *      message is a GET and parsing out the path to the file we are
             *      GETing. Recall that for GET HTTP packets, the first line of
             *      the received packet will look something like:
             *
             *          GET /path/to/file HTTP/1.1
             *   b) Using the parsed path to the target file, construct an
             *      HTTP reply and write it to Socket.getOutputStream(). If the
             *      file exists, the HTTP reply should be formatted as follows:
             *
             *        HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\n
             *        Server: FileServer\r\n
             *        \r\n
             *        FILE CONTENTS HERE\r\n
             *
             *      If the specified file does not exist, you should return a
             *      reply with an error code 404 Not Found. This reply should be
             *      formatted as:
             *
             *        HTTP/1.0 404 Not Found\r\n
             *        Server: FileServer\r\n
             *        \r\n
             *
             * If you wish to do so, you are free to re-use code from
             * MiniProject 2 to help with completing this MiniProject.
